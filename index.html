            <div class="contentinfo">
                <div><p class="p2">Masterminded by German industrial designer <em>Alexander Neumeister</em>, the <strong>500 series Shinkansen</strong> cost an estimated 5 billion yen to construct per train and only 9 were ever built. <br>
                        They were originally used on the primary <b>Nozomi</b> service on <i><u>Tōkaidō Shinkansen</u></i> and <i><u>Sanyo Shinkansen</u></i> lines but were downgraded to the Kodama service between Shin-Ōsaka and Hakata in 2010. <br>
                        The 500 series was designed to provide a smoother and safer ride than previous Shinkansen models by using dampers between cars to improve stability and computer-controlled active suspension in the running gear. <br> 
                        The front of the train was also designed to resemble a kingfisher’s beak in order to increase speed and reduce the noise level to improve passenger comfort.</p> 
                        <img class="contentboximage" src="./images/500series.jpg" alt="500series"></div>
                <div><p class="p2">These Shinkansen, operated by <strong>JR East</strong>, come in either 8 or 10 car sets. The 10-car trains can be coupled with <strong>E3 series trains</strong>. <br>
                        A total of 502 E2 series trains were built between 1997 and 2010 before withdrawls of this Shinkansen type started in 2013.</p> 
                        <img class="contentboximage" src="./images/E2series.jpg" alt="E2series"></div>
                <div><p class="p2">With a production process overseen by industrial designer <em>Kenji Ekuan</em>, <strong>E3 series Shinkansen</strong> was built to coincide with the opening of the new Akita Shinkansen <i>“mini-shinkansen”</i> <br>
                        line between Morioka and Akita and used on Komachi services. They were later introduced for use on Tsubasa services on the <i><u>Yamagata Shinkansen Line</u></i>.
                        Similar to the 400 series of trains, they were designed to have a smaller loading gauge than mainline Shinkansen trains to fit on the narrower <i>“mini-shinkansen”</i> lines.</p> 
                        <img class="contentboximage" src="./images/E3series.jpg" alt="E3series"></div>
                <div><p class="p2">Like the E1 series, <strong>E4 trains</strong> are <u>bi-level</u> Shinkansen with double-decker cars designed to accommodate high commuter traffic in the areas around Tokyo and other urban zones. <br> 
                        The 8-car sets can be coupled together to form a 16-car train with a total capacity of 1,634 seated passengers.</p> 
                        <img class="contentboximage" src="./images/E4series.jpg" alt="E4series"></div>
                <div><p class="p2">Part of the next generation of Shinkansen produced in the late ’90s, 700 series trains were jointly designed by JR Central and JR-West.<br>
                        They were originally used on the <em>Hakata Minami Line</em>, the <em>Sanyo Shinkansen</em>, and the <em>Tokaido Shinkansen</em>, although they have since been withdrawn from service on the latter line. <br>
                        These trains are distinctive for their flat <i>‘duck-bill’</i>front nose, which was designed to reduce the piston effect when entering tunnels.</p>
